# Conway's Life using Canvas

This started life as a quick experiment with canvas -- and what better way 
than to run [Conway's Game of Life][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life]
in the browser.

At this point, it needs more work to restructure and maybe make it a reusable
component with pluggable algorithms.  One day.
